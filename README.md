# python_template

This repository is intended to serve as a base for new Python repositories.
Not everything is necessarily up to date and working.
Each file (especially the workflows) may need to be updated.

Many files need to be adjusted to the actual package name. Searching for `python_template` in all files is a good starting point.

The repository settings should also be checked in any case.
Especially all settings that concern security.
It must be verified who has access to the repository.
