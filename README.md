# Photobooth

This is currently a small script I wrote a few years ago for a friends' wedding.
I currently just set up this repo to save this old script.

The box took photos, assembled them and printed them using cups.

There are multiple LEDs and a single button for user interaction.

The python script was started on boot using the `/etc/rc.local` file.
